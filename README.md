# sparql-browser

This is the AIR runtime version of my SPARQL Query Browser.

The application comes with some predefined endpoints and queries built in.

If you want to add your own edit the queries.xml file in the config directory where the application is installed. Future versions will let you load the xml directly. See the HowTo wiki.

You can also type the endpoint address directly into the input box.

You will have to install the Adobe AIR runtime prior to installing the application.

Quite a few features were the idea of Erick Antezana over at http://www.semantic-systems-biology.org. Thanks Erick.
